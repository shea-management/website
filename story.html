                            Shea Management Services, or SMS started back when SMS’ were a thing.  Before they were just texts.  We’ve changed and evolved over the years, including running two of our own businesses in coffee and solar.  
                            <br> <br>
                            Our director, Kylie, took her “spare” time between managing the solar business, running a household and raising four children, to study and qualify to become a registered BAS Agent. 
                            <br> <br>
                            Since 2015, we have moved beyond our own family businesses to use our knowledge and skills to help other small businesses.  First in our local area, and now Australia wide through the power of cloud technology.  We continue to offer BAS Agent services like bookkeeping and administration to clients, but are now also branching out further.
                            <br> <br>
                            It seems the entrepreneurial ability runs in the family and we now offer design and IT services.  The eldest of four children, Isaac, is currently studying a dual degree at QUT in design and IT.  Prior to this he has completed his Cert III in Screen & Media, worked freelance in design, trying his hand across Fiverr on logos and icons, designing advertising for the Porsche Club magazine, releasing a game on the App Store and Google Play Store, and composed music for another mobile game release too.

                            If you haven't already noticed, we dropped 'services' from our name recently, and we've expanded beyond just bookkeeping. 
                            <br>
                            We're working towards becoming a place where you can go for everything related to a business, that being management, marketing, business resources and more.
                            <br> <br>
                            The nerds in our R&D department have been putting together the Shea Marketplace, a brilliant way to get  digital resources for your business and personal life. It's currently in development, and we'll be releasing more about it as we get closer to a launch!

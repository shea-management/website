                        Doing your books in days gone by included data entry, chasing up paperwork, filing and other mundane and time wasting tasks.  Using up to date technology and cloud services we streamline this process.  Simply take a photo of the receipt or email direct from your inbox and your data entry is done!  We can step you through this process and even automate it for you. 
                        <br> <br>
                        You can be as hands on in your books as you’d like.  If the thought of GST, BAS, TPAR, WorkCover and the ATO is what your dreams are made of, then we work with you to ensure you meet these deadlines with correct data and continue on your business journey.  If all of those letters are just confusing and scary, we can do the lot!  Take the stress out of each BAS period and especially at end of financial year.  By keeping your accounts up to date and correct these lodgements are much easier and you can have a finger on the pulse of your business each and every day.
